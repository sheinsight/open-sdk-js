â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts          # Main entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ signature.ts      # Core signature logic
â””â”€â”€ types.ts          # Type definitions

tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ signature.test.ts # Core functionality tests

## Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**
   - CI pipeline runs tests, linting, and type checking
   - All checks must pass

2. **Code Review**
   - At least one maintainer review required
   - Address feedback and update PR as needed

3. **Merge**
   - PRs are merged using "Squash and merge"
   - Commit message follows conventional commits

## Security

- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, secrets)
- Follow security best practices
- Report security vulnerabilities privately to maintainers
